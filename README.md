## File Structure
We are grouping by feature as listed in the React docs. See
[Grouping by features or routes](https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-structure.html#grouping-by-features-or-routes)

## Linting
We are using [ESLint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint) with [Airbnb rules](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript), alongside [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) to format code and follow modern standards when writing JavaScript. In addition, we can minimize runtime errors.

## Memoized Custom Hook For Sorting
We are taking advantage of [Custom Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-custom.html) and [Memoization](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-custom.html) to abstract sorting into a testable and robust unit of code.
